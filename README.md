# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using machine learning techniques.  
The model analyzes various car features such as present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and number of previous owners to estimate the car's selling price.

This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship – Task 3**.
